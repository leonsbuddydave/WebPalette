# WebPalette

Command palette for the open web.

Todo:
* Genuine fuzzy filtering of options and result match highlighting
* Extension encapsulation (i.e. containing styles to prevent the plugin from interfering with display of host pages and vice versa)
* User configuration options
* ~~Option to include question text with arbitrary user input~~
* Command Map easy-generation tooling
* Inverted command conditionals
* Remote analytics and error reporting to help flag when a command is out of date
* Full screen-reader support
* Command history taken into account when searching
* Variable templating against arrays in command data objects
* Unit tests
* Integration tests against supported websites
